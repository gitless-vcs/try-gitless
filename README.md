# Try Gitless

Gitless (gl) is a version control system built on top of Git. Gitless is an experiment to see what happens if you put a simple veneer on an app that changes the underlying concepts. Because Gitless is implemented on top of Git, you can always fall back on Git.

The files in this repository can be used to try gitless using the instructions found on https://gitless.com.
